      <p className="text-lg font-medium">
        I started my journey as a curious learner, diving into HTML and CSS.
        Over time, I mastered JavaScript and explored frameworks like React,
        constantly pushing myself to create intuitive, responsive user
        interfaces. Today, I focus on delivering clean, performant, and engaging
        web experiences, always evolving with the latest technologies.
