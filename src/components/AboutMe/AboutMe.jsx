      <p className="text-lg font-medium">
        My programming journey began in university, where I built a strong
        foundation in C, C++, and Java. As I transitioned into web development,
        I gained experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with backend
        technologies like PHP and Laravel. Later, I delved into modern
        JavaScript frameworks, mastering React to create dynamic and responsive
        user interfaces. Additionally, I have worked with Express.js and
        MongoDB, enabling me to develop full-stack applications. Passionate
        about building clean, efficient, and user-centric solutions, I
        continuously explore emerging technologies to enhance my expertise and
        deliver high-quality web experiences.
